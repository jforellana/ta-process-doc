# STUDENT LUNCHES WITH MIKE MAUGHAN

As his schedule permits, Mike Maughan likes to come to campus and have lunch with students from class. Around 15 students will be invited for each lunch. A document needs to be prepared with the following information: name of each student attending; hometown or country of origin in student is not from the US; mention whether they have declared a major or not and what it is; short (5 sentences) bio, mentioning their year in school and anything else they would like to share; what their post-graduation or internship plans are; upload a picture of themselves. TA’s are encouraged to attend one of the lunches as well!

### Capturing information for bio doc

There are a number of ways that the information can be captured and that the students can be selected. This will be up to you. Below are some options:
•	Option 1: Create a Qualtrics survey that asks for all the information that you will need for the bio doc.
o	 Distribute the survey to the class at the beginning of the semester so you have all the information that you need. 
o	As you are notified of lunch dates, send an announcement to the class asking who would be interested and able to attend, and then select which students will attend on a first-come-first-serve basis as you get responses.
	Make sure to email the students you selected to confirm their attendance.
	Ask if they have any dietary restrictions.
o	Once you have the list of 15 students, make sure that they have completed the Qualtrics survey and pull their info from the survey to create the bio doc. 
o	Email the bio doc to Mike at least the night before lunch.
•	Option 2: As you are notified of lunch dates, send an announcement to the class asking who would be interested and able to attend, and then select which students will attend based on the responses that you get.
o	Once you have selected the students, email them to confirm their attendance and ask them to send you the information that you will need for the bio doc. 
	Ask if they have any dietary restrictions
o	Email the bio doc to Mike at least the night before lunch.
•	Option 3: Try to implement another idea!

### Scheduling
Mike usually will not be able to give us more than a week or a few days' notice of when he is available for lunch. This makes it complicated when trying to reserve a room. Instead of waiting to hear from him to reserve a conference room, it is recommended that a conference room (like 750 or W352) is reserved each week at the same times for the whole semester. 
Mike will tell you which day he is more likely to be able to come for lunch. Reserve a conference room for that day of the week and at the time that Mike mentions for the whole semester. If Mike does not confirm that he is coming for lunch on a given week, then call the Deans Office to cancel the reservation for that week. 

### Ordering Food
Once the list of attendees has been finalized and it has been determined if there are any dietary restrictions that need to be considered, the food will be ordered. The normal places that we order lunch from are Apple Spice and Jimmy Johns. Other restaurants are okay as long as you get approval from Dean Madrian or JaLee Clarke. 
Place the order for everyone attending and then two-three more in case that there is a guest of the Dean decides to join. When placing the order, ask for it to be delivered to the BYU Marriott Deans Office around 20-30 minutes before lunch. 
The delivery address for the Deans Office is the following:
**_730 TNRB_**
**_Brigham Young University_**
**_Provo, UT 84602-3113_**
To pay for the order, visit the Deans Office and ask for the Deans Office card. The student employee who gives you the card will teach you how to check it out and will explain that you need to provide a receipt. If you are making the order online, put your email on the order so you get the electronic receipt. Once you receive it, forward it to [deanfinance-pt@byu.edu](mailto:deanfinance-pt@byu.edu).
