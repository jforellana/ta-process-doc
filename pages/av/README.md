# PREPARING FOR CLASS: AUDIO/VISUALS

Every week, either Mike Maughan or his assistant will send the Google Slide that will be used for that week’s class. The Google Slide will need to be opened from the room PC to be displayed on the projector.

### Using the PC and projector
To use the room PC, login with your BYU NetID and password (if your BYU email is john@byu.edu, your NetID is john). 
To use the room projector, tap the control box next to the podium. In the Display tab, select the screen that you wish to project. For more additional help with the projector, contact BYU OIT. 
If the presentation has videos or motion-enabled graphs, test them before class begins (and before the projector is turned on) to make sure that everything works correctly. If possible, try testing the presentation 15 minutes before class begins. This will give you enough time to work on any adjustments.
If there are videos included in the presentation, play a part of them and adjust the volume in the room.

### Using and reserving microphones
Because of the nature of class, there will be one interviewer/host and one or two guests. Each week we need to have three lapel microphones in the room. The auditorium already has one. To reserve two more, call the BYU AV support office. 
Usually, the mics can only be reserved for one event/meeting/class at a time. If possible, it is recommended that you try to reserve the mics in advance for the whole semester. Depending on the workload and frequency with which other departments reserve them, it might be possible to reserve the mics in advance. If you ask and they say it is not possible, you still want to make sure that mics are reserved each week for class. 
To ensure that mics are always available, it is strongly advised to reserve them one week in advance. If class is on Wednesday at noon, for example, you should contact the BYU AV office on Wednesday afternoon or Thursday to make the reservation for the next week. 
When making the reservation, try to reserve the mics for at least 30 minutes before class starts. This will allow that there is enough time to test them and to think of alternative options in case that the mics are not provided on time.
Student employees will bring the microphones to the room. At that time, and before they leave, test the microphones with them. Test each one by itself, and then test the in-house mic with the ones they bring together to make sure that they make no interference noise. Make sure that the volume is appropriate (if you are testing the mics before class and there are not many students, adjust the mics to a louder volume than you would usually prefer; when the room gets full, the mics won’t sound as loud), and try to make sure that the batteries are not close to dying. 
The auditorium will also have hand-held microphones available in the booth where the projector is. Bring two hand-held microphones to the podium as back-up.

### Zoom (consult with Dean Madrian)
For historical recording purposes, class is to be recorded over Zoom. Students will ask if it is possible to join over Zoom if they are not able to attend in person. Unless Dean Madrian says otherwise, this is not allowed. At the beginning of each class, start a zoom meeting with the room camera and microphones on, and start recording. When class ends, stop recording and close Zoom. Save the recording in a Box folder.
