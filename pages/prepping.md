# PREPARING FOR CLASS: ROOM SET-UP

The set-up of the room will consist of two or three chairs which will be placed in the front of the room, depending on whether there will be one or two guests on that lecture day. Make the seats look symmetrical with respect to the room. The first middle row of the room will be reserved for faculty and guests. Print reserved signs for those seats and place them on those seats so students do not occupy them. Bring bottled waters for the guests in the first row and for the host and guests. Place them next to their chairs.



# PREPARING FOR CLASS: PARKING RESERVATIONS
Parking reservations need to be made for Mike Maughan, Ryan Smith, and their guests each week. You can make parking reservations for the Tanner Building through the system in marriott.byu.edu. After submitting the parking reservation, email byumarriottdeansoffice@byu.edu to confirm that the reservation was made, and to make Ryan and Mike’s reservations automatic for every class day for the semester. 
It is important to note that there are only six parking spots that can be reserved by the Deans Office, so it is highly recommended that the parking reservations are made with enough time in advance so that we always have space.
After submitting the ticket, email parking@byu.edu with the car details of everyone. Please note, the ticket that you submit through the BYU Marriott website is to reserve a parking spot. The email for parking is to clear the guests’ car plates in the BYU police system so they don’t receive a ticket for parking on campus premises.
