# OVERVIEW

The Executive Lecture Series with Ryan Smith and Mike Maughan happens each Fall semester. Guests come to share their experiences and stories regarding their professional development and growth. Your job as a Teaching Assistant for this class is to ensure that the different aspects for class (equipment and parking reservations, Canvas and room set-up, grading, video and audio, etc.) are accounted for and taking care of so that the guest speakers, interviewers, and students can have a meaningful and seamless experience. This document is intended to help you know what to do in each step of the process (before the semester begins, before each class, during class, and after class).
